# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Multi-Agent Workflow

Multiple Claude agents may work on this project simultaneously. Follow these rules:

- **NEVER fix bugs you didn't introduce** - if you see errors from another agent's work, leave them alone
- Only fix issues in code you are actively modifying
- If a build fails due to someone else's changes, inform the user rather than fixing it yourself
- Coordinate through the user, not by modifying each other's work

## Git Workflow

### Push (git only, no deploy)

When user says "push", "push to git", "commit and push":

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --stat` to see all changes
2. Run `git log --oneline -3` to match commit message style
3. Stage everything with `git add .`
4. Commit with a concise message describing the changes:
   - Use conventional commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
   - Keep the first line short, add bullet points for details if needed
   - End with the Claude Code attribution block
5. Push to remote with `git push`

### Deploy (push + TestFlight + Mac agent)

When user says "deploy", "deploy to testflight", or "push and deploy":

1. Follow all push steps above
2. Run `source .env && fastlane deploy` to:
   - Build and launch Mac agent locally
   - Build iOS app and upload to TestFlight

## Build and Run Commands

```bash
# Deploy everything (Mac agent + iOS to TestFlight)
source .env && fastlane deploy

# iOS to TestFlight only
source .env && fastlane ios beta_local

# Mac agent only (build + launch)
source .env && fastlane mac build_agent

# Build iOS for connected iPhone (without TestFlight)
xcodebuild -project Cloude/Cloude.xcodeproj -scheme Cloude -destination 'platform=iOS,name=My iPhone' build

# Clean build
xcodebuild -project Cloude/Cloude.xcodeproj -scheme Cloude clean
```

Open `Cloude/Cloude.xcodeproj` in Xcode to run on device.

## Deployment Setup

### App Store Connect
- **iOS App Bundle ID**: `soli.Cloude`
- **Mac Agent Bundle ID**: `soli.Cloude-Agent`
- **Team ID**: `Q9U8224WWM`
- **SKU**: `cloude-ios`

### iOS App Capabilities (enabled in App Store Connect)
- App Groups (`group.soli.Cloude`)
- Push Notifications
- Siri
- Time Sensitive Notifications
- Associated Domains
- iCloud (with CloudKit)

### Fastlane Configuration
Located in `fastlane/Fastfile` with three lanes:
- `fastlane deploy` - builds both Mac agent and iOS, uploads iOS to TestFlight
- `fastlane ios beta_local` - iOS to TestFlight only
- `fastlane mac build_agent` - builds and launches Mac agent locally

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
Required for deployment:
```
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID=<key_id>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_ISSUER_ID=<issuer_id>
APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_CONTENT="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
<key_content>
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

The `.env` file is gitignored. API key is from App Store Connect > Users and Access > Keys.

## Architecture

### iOS App (Cloude)
- `ConnectionManager`: WebSocket client connecting to Mac agent
- `ChatView`: Main chat interface for sending prompts to Claude
- `SettingsView`: Connection settings, auth token, debug info

### macOS Agent (Cloude Agent)
- `WebSocketServer`: Accepts connections from iOS app, handles auth
- `ClaudeCodeRunner`: Spawns Claude Code CLI process with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- `AuthManager`: Generates and stores 256-bit auth token in Keychain

### Security Model
- Auth token required for all commands (256-bit, cryptographically random)
- Token stored in macOS/iOS Keychain
- No TLS - rely on Tailscale for encryption (see `plans/secure.md` for future improvements)

## Code Style

### General
- **NEVER add comments to code** - no inline comments, no docstrings, no file header comments (except the file name/module line). Code should be self-explanatory through clear naming.
- Avoid single-use helpers and variables
- Struct-first design for models and services
- Keep views lean with small composable structs
- Use explicit imports (no wildcards)
- Favor happy path with `if let`/`guard let`; avoid defensive detours
- Let errors propagate unless explicit handling is requested

### UI/Logic Separation
- **UI files should NOT contain**: date calculations, string formatting logic, data filtering/sorting, validation rules
- **Logic files should NOT contain**: SwiftUI views, colors, fonts, layout code
- Services should be pure structs with static methods when possible
