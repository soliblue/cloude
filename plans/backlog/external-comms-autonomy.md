# External Communication Channels

Cloude currently only communicates through the iOS app. No way to receive or send emails, SMS, or messages autonomously.

## Desired Outcome
Give Cloude external channels (email, SMS, messaging) with sender allowlist, action restrictions (no bash/file access from external sources), and a confirmation queue for sensitive actions. Heartbeat can check inbound and respond to trusted senders.

**Files:** New services, iOS quarantine/approval UI, heartbeat integration
