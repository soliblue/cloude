# Granular Post-Conversation Reflections

The current `/reflect` skill analyzes everything at once. The most useful insights come right after specific work — suggested skills from repeated patterns, refactor targets from touched files, small memory updates from new context.

## Desired Outcome
After each conversation, a lightweight analysis (Haiku) checks for: instant skill suggestions, targeted refactor opportunities, and memory drip updates. Presented for approval, not auto-applied. Depends on conversation summaries.

**Files:** Reflect skill, new post-conversation hook, skillsmith integration
