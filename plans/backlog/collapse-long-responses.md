# Collapse Long Previous Responses

Older assistant responses (10+ lines) take up too much vertical space on mobile. Scrolling through long conversations means wading through walls of already-read text.

## Desired Outcome
Auto-collapse previous assistant responses beyond a threshold, showing first few lines with a "Show more" tap target. Latest response always fully expanded.

**Files:** Message bubble views, state tracking per message
