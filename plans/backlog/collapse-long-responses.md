# Collapse Long Previous Responses {arrow.up.and.down.text.horizontal}

> Older assistant responses (10+ lines) take up too much vertical space on mobile. Scrolling through long conversations means wading through walls of already-read text. Auto-collapse previous responses beyond a threshold.

## Desired Outcome
Auto-collapse previous assistant responses beyond a threshold, showing first few lines with a "Show more" tap target. Latest response always fully expanded.
