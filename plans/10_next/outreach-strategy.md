# Outreach Strategy — Align Online Persona with Offline Reality

## Context
Soli's IRL impact is massive (rockstar employee, 30 VisionPro demos, 6 Claude Code sessions/week, founding CTO experience) but his online presence doesn't reflect it. Goal: get recognition from companies like Anthropic where his work would be a perfect fit.

## Justin's Sales Framework
Advice from Justin (close friend, sales/outreach expert):

### Core Principles
1. **Volume is way higher than you think** — 50 messages feels like a lot but success might be at 300 or 3000. You're stopping before you even get close to what success looks like.
2. **Track everything** — without data you don't know what's working. Number of messages, response rates, which approach gets replies.
3. **Sequences, not single messages** — one cold message is weak. A sequence of 3-6 messages with increasing value is how sales actually works.
4. **The breakup message** — final message in a sequence leaves something tangible ("here's my GitHub, here's what I built with Claude Code"). They can always come back to it later.
5. **Constant cycling** — reach out, send a 3-message sequence, circle back in 3 months with another sequence, repeat. Be impossible to ignore.

### Sequence Template
1. **First touch** — intro + one compelling thing (Cloude demo, Claude Code expertise)
2. **Follow-up 1** (3-5 days) — add value, share something relevant they'd care about
3. **Follow-up 2** (5-7 days) — different angle, maybe a specific insight or result
4. **Breakup message** (7-10 days) — "no worries if not the right time, here's my GitHub/portfolio, I'll have something even crazier in a few months"
5. **Re-engage** (3 months later) — new sequence with new material

### What to Track
- Who was contacted, when, which sequence step
- Response rate per step
- What messaging/angle got responses
- Total outreach volume per month

## Targets
- Anthropic (primary — building the most impressive Claude Code project)
- Other AI companies where Cloude + Claude Code expertise is relevant

## Assets to Showcase
- Cloude: iOS app + Mac agent controlling Claude Code from phone
- Memory system, agent teams, heartbeat, skills
- 6 sessions/week onboarding non-technical people to Claude Code
- biddz.io founding CTO (fought Apple and won)
- Deep Claude Code expertise + SwiftUI + full-stack

## TODO
- [ ] Identify specific people at Anthropic to reach out to
- [ ] Build a tracking system (spreadsheet or plan file)
- [ ] Draft first sequence (3-4 messages)
- [ ] Set monthly outreach volume target
- [ ] Create portfolio/demo material (video? thread? GitHub readme?)

## Codex Review

**Findings (ordered by risk)**
1. **Critical:** The plan is activity-heavy but positioning-light. Without a sharp "why hire Soli for this exact role now" thesis, more volume just scales noise.
2. **High:** "Volume is key" is unbounded and may burn reputation. No guardrails for personalization quality, reply-rate thresholds, or stopping rules.
3. **High:** Claims/assets may create credibility risk if not packaged with proof. Examples like "fought Apple and won" and "30 VisionPro demos" need verifiable, concise evidence or they can read as hype.
4. **High:** Over-concentration on Anthropic. Single-primary target increases timeline risk; you need parallel lanes with similar-fit companies.
5. **Medium:** Sequence exists, but channel strategy is missing. No plan for warm intros, public content, event follow-ups, or OSS/community touchpoints that improve response rates.
6. **Medium:** Tracking is mentioned, but funnel definitions are missing. You need explicit stage metrics (sent → replied → positive reply → call → referral/interview).
7. **Medium:** Asset plan is incomplete for hiring outcomes. "Portfolio/demo material" should include role-specific one-pagers and short case studies, not just product demos.
8. **Low:** No operating cadence/ownership. No weekly targets, review loop, or iteration process tied to what messages actually convert.

**Improvements**
1. Define a one-sentence positioning thesis: `AI product operator + hands-on agent builder + non-technical enablement at scale`.
2. Build a 3-lane target list: `Tier 1 (10), Tier 2 (30), Tier 3 (60)` across Anthropic + peers.
3. Add quality controls: minimum personalization per message, weekly A/B test only 1 variable, pause sequences below a reply-rate floor.
4. Convert assets into proof pack: 60–90 sec demo video, 1-page "impact memo" (metrics + screenshots + links), 2 case studies (problem, approach, measurable outcome), public GitHub/portfolio landing page with clear CTA.
5. Track a real funnel with weekly review: reply rate, positive-reply rate, meeting-booked rate, referral/interview conversion.
6. Add parallel inbound strategy: weekly technical post + 1 OSS contribution + targeted comments on relevant leaders' posts.
7. Add risk controls: avoid unverifiable phrasing; use concrete, checkable statements.

**Missing Considerations**
1. Which exact roles are you targeting (solutions engineer, product engineer, developer relations, etc.)?
2. What is the offer/CTA per message (15-min teardown, demo, referral ask, role fit discussion)?
3. How will you handle rejection/no-response recycling beyond "3 months" (new proof, new angle, new role)?
