# Header Compact Layout {rectangle.compress.vertical}

> Fix header truncation by removing branch text and reducing tab padding.

Reduce header cramping when cost info is shown. Right side content (conversation name, folder, cost) was getting truncated.

## Changes
- Removed branch name text from git tab button (icon only, like chat and folder tabs)
- Reduced tab button padding from 7pt to 4pt

## Files
- Cloude/Cloude/UI/MainChatView.swift
