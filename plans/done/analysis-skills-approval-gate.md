# Analysis Skills: Approval Gate + Plan Tickets

## What
Updated /refactor, /reflect, and /skillsmith to require Soli's approval before implementing any suggestions. When approved, a plan ticket must be created in plans/active/ or plans/testing/ before starting work.

## Why
These skills analyze and suggest changes, but shouldn't act autonomously. The approval gate ensures Soli controls what gets implemented, and the ticket requirement keeps the plans/ system as the single source of truth for all work.
