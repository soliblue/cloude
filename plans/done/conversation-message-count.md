# Message Count in Conversation Picker

Show message count next to relative time in the recent conversations list on the window edit form.

## Files
- `Cloude/Cloude/UI/WindowEditForm.swift`

## Notes
- Added `X msgs` below the relative time in a trailing-aligned VStack
- The "See All" view (WindowConversationPicker) already had message counts
