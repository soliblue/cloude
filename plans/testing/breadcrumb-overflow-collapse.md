# Breadcrumb Overflow — Collapse to Last 2

Show only root + `…` + last 2 parent components instead of 3 when path has 4+ segments. Keeps breadcrumb from overflowing screen width.

**File**: `Cloude/Cloude/UI/FileViewerBreadcrumb.swift`

**How to test**: Open a deeply nested file like `/Users/soli/Desktop/CODING/cloude/Cloude/Cloude Agent/Services/AutocompleteService.swift` — breadcrumb should fit on screen without horizontal overflow.
