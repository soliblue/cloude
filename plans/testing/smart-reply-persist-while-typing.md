# Smart Reply: Persist While Typing

Keep smart reply suggestion bubbles visible while user types up to 10 characters.
Previously they disappeared on the first keystroke.

- Suggestions stay visible until 10 chars typed
- Hide immediately when slash commands or file suggestions appear
- Tapping a suggestion still fills the input and clears them
- Also added top padding (8pt) for breathing room above bubbles
