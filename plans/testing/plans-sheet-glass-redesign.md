# Plans Sheet Glass Redesign
<!-- build: 61 -->

## Problem
Plans sheet uses solid white/opaque backgrounds (`Color(.secondarySystemGroupedBackground)`) for the stage picker and plan cards. Looks heavy, too much white, poor design compared to the rest of the app's glass aesthetic.

## Solution
- Replace opaque card backgrounds with translucent material/glass effects
- Stage picker: ultra-thin material with subtle glass feel
- Plan cards: translucent glass cards with subtle borders
- Remove heavy solid backgrounds, embrace transparency
- Match the glass aesthetic used in HeartbeatSheet and MemoriesSheet
