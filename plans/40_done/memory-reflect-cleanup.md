# Memory Reflect Cleanup
<!-- priority: 10 -->
<!-- build: 56 -->

## Summary
Ran /reflect skill to analyze and reorganize CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md. Used Sonnet worker + Codex second opinion.

## Changes
- Fixed corrupted entries in both files (malformed `cloude memory` commands created orphan `## "Code` and `## "Session` sections)
- Consolidated Jan 31 session history (3 entries → 1)
- Added Feb 5-7 to session history (agent teams, file viewer, codex, refactor, tool pills, Twitter demo)
- Removed Staging section (duplicated plans/testing/ per CLAUDE.md rules)
- Demoted Moltbook from root section to subsection under Open Threads
- Removed implemented "Screenshot command" from Vision
- Structure: 6 root sections → 4 (within 5x5x5 rule)
