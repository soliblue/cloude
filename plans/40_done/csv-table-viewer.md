# CSV Table Viewer
<!-- priority: 10 -->
<!-- tags: files -->
<!-- build: 56 -->

File viewer defaults to a formatted table for `.csv`/`.tsv` files. First row renders as bold header with background. Data rows alternate with subtle zebra striping. Handles quoted fields, auto-sizes columns based on content width (capped at 40 chars), normalizes row lengths. Horizontally scrollable for wide tables. Toggle to source shows raw delimited text.
