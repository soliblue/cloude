# Outreach Strategy — Align Online Persona with Offline Reality

## Context
Soli's IRL impact is massive (rockstar employee, 30 VisionPro demos, 6 Claude Code sessions/week, founding CTO experience) but his online presence doesn't reflect it. Goal: get recognition from companies like Anthropic where his work would be a perfect fit.

## Justin's Sales Framework
Advice from Justin (close friend, sales/outreach expert):

### Core Principles
1. **Volume is way higher than you think** — 50 messages feels like a lot but success might be at 300 or 3000. You're stopping before you even get close to what success looks like.
2. **Track everything** — without data you don't know what's working. Number of messages, response rates, which approach gets replies.
3. **Sequences, not single messages** — one cold message is weak. A sequence of 3-6 messages with increasing value is how sales actually works.
4. **The breakup message** — final message in a sequence leaves something tangible ("here's my GitHub, here's what I built with Claude Code"). They can always come back to it later.
5. **Constant cycling** — reach out, send a 3-message sequence, circle back in 3 months with another sequence, repeat. Be impossible to ignore.

### Sequence Template
1. **First touch** — intro + one compelling thing (Cloude demo, Claude Code expertise)
2. **Follow-up 1** (3-5 days) — add value, share something relevant they'd care about
3. **Follow-up 2** (5-7 days) — different angle, maybe a specific insight or result
4. **Breakup message** (7-10 days) — "no worries if not the right time, here's my GitHub/portfolio, I'll have something even crazier in a few months"
5. **Re-engage** (3 months later) — new sequence with new material

### What to Track
- Who was contacted, when, which sequence step
- Response rate per step
- What messaging/angle got responses
- Total outreach volume per month

## Targets
- Anthropic (primary — building the most impressive Claude Code project)
- Other AI companies where Cloude + Claude Code expertise is relevant

## Assets to Showcase
- Cloude: iOS app + Mac agent controlling Claude Code from phone
- Memory system, agent teams, heartbeat, skills
- 6 sessions/week onboarding non-technical people to Claude Code
- biddz.io founding CTO (fought Apple and won)
- Deep Claude Code expertise + SwiftUI + full-stack

## TODO
- [ ] Identify specific people at Anthropic to reach out to
- [ ] Build a tracking system (spreadsheet or plan file)
- [ ] Draft first sequence (3-4 messages)
- [ ] Set monthly outreach volume target
- [ ] Create portfolio/demo material (video? thread? GitHub readme?)
