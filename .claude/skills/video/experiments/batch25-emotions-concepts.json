    "prompt": "Synesthesia visualization: a piano chord being played, the sound waves become visible as ribbons of warm gold and cool blue light spiraling outward from the keys, each note a different color thread weaving through dark space, the vibrations create geometric patterns in the air. Shot like a music video, shallow DOF, 16mm film grain.",

    "prompt": "Time-lapse of rust forming on a beautiful Art Deco chrome sculpture, months compressed into seconds, the patina spreads like watercolor on metal, green and orange oxidation creating organic patterns on geometric forms, rain water pools and evaporates, nature reclaiming human art. Macro lens, golden hour light.",

    "prompt": "Origami paper folding itself in stop motion, a flat white sheet becomes a crane in real time, each fold precise and deliberate, the paper casting sharp shadows on a black background, warm spotlight from above, the finished crane takes one breath and its wings shift slightly. Overhead camera, Wes Anderson symmetry.",

    "prompt": "A single raindrop falling in extreme slow motion into a puddle on a cobblestone street in Paris, the splash creates a perfect crown then collapses, reflections of the Eiffel Tower visible in the expanding ripples, warm evening light from street lamps, bokeh of passing cars. Phantom high-speed camera, 10000fps feel.",

  {
    "prompt": "Hand-drawn charcoal portrait on cream paper, a woman's face slowly being sketched by an invisible hand, rough expressive strokes build up the features, smudging creates shadows, the eyes appear last and seem to look directly at the viewer, charcoal dust falls from the surface, warm atelier lighting.",
