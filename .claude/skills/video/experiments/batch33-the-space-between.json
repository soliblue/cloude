    "prompt": "An empty airport terminal at 3am, flickering fluorescent lights cast green-blue tones, a single janitor's cart sits abandoned, departure boards show no flights, the escalators run empty, liminal space between destinations.

    "prompt": "The moment between lightning and thunder, the world is frozen in anticipation, wind pauses mid-gust, leaves hang suspended, clouds glow from within waiting to roar, a child's hand reaches for a door that hasn't opened yet. Temporal pause, everything held in tension.",
