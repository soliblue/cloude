    "prompt": "A clock melting like Dalí's Persistence of Memory but in photorealistic 3D, the metal and glass liquefy and drip off a marble table, gears and springs spill out in slow motion, warm afternoon light through a window, everything else in the room is perfectly normal. Surrealism meets reality.",

    "prompt": "A photograph being burned from the center outward in extreme macro, the flame eats through a family portrait revealing another photograph underneath from a different era, layers of memory combusting, curling edges glow amber, ash floats upward catching light. Shot on macro 100mm.",

    "prompt": "A tree growing from sapling to ancient oak in 10 seconds, seasons cycle rapidly around it — snow falls and melts, leaves burst green then turn gold then drop, the trunk thickens and bark deepens, roots push through earth visibly. Timelapse on steroids, 35mm film grain.",

    "prompt": "Mercury liquid metal pooling on a black mirror surface, the reflective blob splits and merges, smaller droplets race to rejoin the mass, light dances across the impossibly perfect mirror surface, no fingerprints no dust just pure liquid metal physics. Shot overhead, studio lighting.",

    "prompt": "A vinyl record playing in extreme close-up, the stylus needle rides the grooves, visible sound waves emanate from the contact point as translucent ripples in the air, warm tube amplifier glow in background, dust particles drift through amber lamplight. Analog warmth, 16mm film.",
