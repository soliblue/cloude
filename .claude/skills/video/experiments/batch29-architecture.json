    "prompt": "MC Escher staircase paradox brought to life, impossible architecture where stairs lead up and down simultaneously, figures walk in perpetual loops defying gravity, black and white lithograph style, the camera pans revealing the spatial contradiction. Monochrome, geometric precision, mind-bending.",

    "prompt": "Floating Gaudí cathedral made of organic curves and mosaics drifts through clouds, the structure defies physics with spiraling towers and liquid stone, stained glass windows glow from within, the building breathes and shifts subtly as if alive.
