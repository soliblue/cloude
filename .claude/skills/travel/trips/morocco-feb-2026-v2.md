## Survival Tips
### Ramadan (Feb 17 – Mar 19)
- Most local restaurants close daytime or limited hours (10am-4pm)
- Tourist hotels, riads, international chains stay open
- Don't eat/drink/smoke publicly during daylight — respect, not law
- Eat in your accommodation during the day
- Alcohol harder to find — high-end hotels serve indoors with food
- ⚠️ Avoid traveling 6-7:30pm — be at destination by 5:30pm (iftar shutdown)
- Streets quieter during day, VERY lively after sunset
- Dinner service starts later (8pm+) to align with iftar

### Scam Awareness
- "Helpful" strangers = fake guides. Say "La, shukran" and keep walking
- If lost, go INTO a shop and ask owner (won't leave their store)
- Photos at Jemaa el-Fnaa = they WILL demand 20-50 MAD
- Taxi change scam — have exact cash
- Someone says "it's closed" = ignore, verify yourself

### Money
- ATMs everywhere (Visa/Mastercard), dispense 100/200 MAD — break them immediately
- Keep 500-1000 MAD in small bills (20s, 50s) daily
- Cash > cards for bargaining power
- 1 EUR ≈ 11 MAD

### Bargaining
- Seller quotes price → quarter it (they'll laugh = game starts)
- Final price = 1/3 to 1/2 of initial quote
- Shop early morning = first sale is "good luck", better deals
- Use Arabic! "ghali ktir" (too expensive), "ana masri" (I'm Egyptian)
- Be polite, friendly — it's a sport, not a battle

### Food & Safety
- Busy street food stalls = safe (high turnover), empty stalls = avoid
- Bottled water only, no tap water
- Covered shoulders/knees in religious areas
- Medina at night = safe in main areas, avoid dark alleys alone
- Sunset ~6:30pm — plan rooftop drinks for 6pm

### Shopping
Real argan oil = pharmacies (80-120 MAD), NOT souks (often fake).

### Medical
Pharmacies everywhere, sell antibiotics OTC. If severe diarrhea: Imodium + ORS packets first, buy Azithromycin at pharmacy if needed.

### Quick Ref
- 1 EUR ≈ 11 MAD
- Street food: 20-40 MAD (€2-4)
- Restaurant: 80-150 MAD (€7-14)
- Rooftop cocktail: 120-170 MAD (€11-15)
